# css-art

Welcome to the project _CSS Art_, a beginner-friendly challenge for Hacktoberfest!

This project is for the designer in you. Let your creativity flow and create art with HTML and CSS.
No matter if picture, shape, or animation. Anything you come up with get accepted unless you don't violate the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFKOhyUqMZzrZcbq8A_TpO5x9J9HK6agv70awCH8pyI/edit) of the Hacktoberfest.
The only rule is that only plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript get accepted.

What is Hacktoberfest?
Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-source software! All you have to do to take part is sign up on their website - and make four pull requests in October.
